# Stress design and sensitivities

Define stress narratives as parameter shocks:

- hazard scaling \(\lambda_i(t)\mapsto c\,\lambda_i(t)\)
- recovery stress \(R\downarrow\)
- correlation stress \(\Sigma\mapsto\Sigma_{\text{stress}}\)
- tail stress \(\nu\downarrow\) (Student-t)

High-\(k\) baskets are dominated by clustering effects.
